# 1. Introduction

## What are Conjoint and MaxDiff analyses?

Conjoint analysis and Maximum Difference Scaling (MaxDiff) are two powerful market research techniques used to understand consumer preferences and decision-making processes.

::: {.callout}
**Conjoint Analysis** measures how people make trade-offs among features when choosing products or services. It simulates real-world purchasing decisions where consumers must balance multiple competing attributes (e.g., price vs. quality vs. brand).

**MaxDiff Analysis** (also known as Best-Worst Scaling) measures the relative importance or preference of items in a list. It asks respondents to select the most and least important/preferred items from subsets of a larger list.

## When to use which method?

| Aspect | Conjoint Analysis | MaxDiff Analysis |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **Primary Use** | Understanding trade-offs between product attributes | Prioritizing features or benefits |
| **Best For** | Product configuration, pricing strategy, market simulation | Feature prioritization, messaging strategy, concept testing |
| **Decision Context** | Complex multi-attribute decisions | Relative importance of individual items |
| **Output** | Part-worth utilities, importance scores, market simulations | Preference scores, importance rankings |
| **Sample Size Needs** | Moderate to large | Can work with smaller samples |

## Key differences

The fundamental difference between these methods lies in their approach to preference measurement:

- **Conjoint Analysis**: Trade-off based approach where respondents evaluate complete product profiles with multiple attributes simultaneously
- **MaxDiff Analysis**: Importance scaling approach where respondents evaluate individual items in isolation

::: {.tip}
**When to choose Conjoint**: Use when you need to understand how consumers make trade-offs between different product features and when you want to simulate market scenarios.

**When to choose MaxDiff**: Use when you need to prioritize a long list of features or benefits and when you want to understand relative importance without trade-offs.
